Millions of homes in developing countries such as South Asia, Africa and South America hae a
water system that requires pumping ground water to a rooftop water tank manually which wastes
a lot of water and electricity, quickly adding up as this system is used many times throughout the
day daily.
Not only does this waste gallons of water but the water that is used is high in turbidity. Many
families take the extra steps in filtering the water by boiling it which is hazardous in causing
burns or filtering it through commercial filters which is not environmentally friendly and
expensive in the long run.
In order to combat these pressing issues, I created an automated water flow system to eliminate
the wastage of water with a sand water filter and also created an app which can keep track of
how much clean water is being used in a household as it is a valuable commodity in these areas.
